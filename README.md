# Wordle Fun

I ~~am really addicted to~~ have come to really enjoy playing Wordle and have been using it as the backdrop for several of my learning projects. The sole purpose of this repo is to help me keep track of ideas I have around it and serve as a navigation page between the various projects.

Ideas (in no particular order):

- [x] command line version of the game
- [x] set up a basic pipeline with github actions
- [ ] build a nicer version with pygame
- [ ] build a tool to suggest next guesses or viable solutions
- [ ] build it in another language 
- [ ] use kivy (or an alternative to make it into a mobile app)
- [ ] host my own version of it on the cloud
- [ ] learn to use sphinx (or another tool) for setting up documentation
- use pylenium to play the game each day and send me the results
- track results in a database
